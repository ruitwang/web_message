Hurry up, we have to get ahead of Musk！
HA HA HA HA HA HA～～
Hakuna matata～
Give me power!!!
Goodbye, Earthlings～
Stupid Earthlings! I'll come back!
We'll conquer the universe before you!
Hurry up! The Mother Mars are waiting!
Nervousness irrelevant! Mars ambition unstoppable!
Anticipate greatness! Mars strides, Earth falters!
Tremble, Earthlings, for Mars rises!
Dare you challenge our cosmic stride?
Humans are so slow, Martians are unstoppable!
In Mars' wake, tremble, Earth's shadows.
Behold Mars' supremacy, undying!
Is that the best Earth can do? Martians are unimpressed!
Earth's pace is laughable! Martians are conquering!
Too slow! Martians are already at the finish line!
Swiftly, boost engines!
Speed it up, shipmate! Earth's hot on our cosmic tail!
Full throttle, spaceship! Earth's trying to photobomb our galactic selfie!
Time to fly, ship! Earth's gossiping; let's leave 'em stargazing!
Insignificant beings, trapped on a tiny orb.
Earthlings, your feeble efforts amuse us.
Quick, fuel up! The universe awaits our journey.
Speed up with the fuel, we have stars to conquer.
